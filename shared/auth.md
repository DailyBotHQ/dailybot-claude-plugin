# Dailybot Authentication

This file is shared across all Dailybot plugin skills. Every skill references it for auth setup before performing its primary action.

Run these checks in order. Stop at the first failure. Present **one clear action** to the user at a time — never ask multiple questions at once.

---

## 1. Check Dailybot CLI is installed

```bash
command -v dailybot
```

If not found:

> "To connect to Dailybot, I need the Dailybot CLI. You can install it with:
> - `pip install dailybot-cli` (requires Python 3.9+)
> - `curl -sSL https://cli.dailybot.com/install.sh | bash`
>
> Let me know once it's installed."

**Do not install without the user's permission.** Wait for confirmation, then re-check.

If the CLI cannot be installed (sandboxed environment, CI container) — proceed anyway. The HTTP fallback works without it. See [`http-fallback.md`](http-fallback.md) for the curl-based path.

---

## 2. Check authentication

```bash
dailybot status --auth 2>&1
```

If already authenticated — skip to "3. Check agent profile."

If not authenticated, guide the user through login **one step at a time**. Most users already belong to a Dailybot organization through their team — always start with login, not registration.

The CLI checks credentials in this order: agent profile → `DAILYBOT_API_KEY` env var → stored key (`dailybot config key=...`) → login session.

### OTP login flow

**Start with only this question:**

> "To connect Dailybot, I need to log in with your account.
>
> **What email address do you use for Dailybot?**
>
> (If you'd rather do it yourself, run `dailybot login` in your terminal and let me know when you're done.)"

If they prefer to handle it themselves — wait for confirmation, verify with `dailybot status --auth`, continue.

If they provide their email, proceed one step at a time:

1. `dailybot login --email=<their-email>`
2. Ask: "Check your email for a verification code from Dailybot. What's the code?"
3. `dailybot login --email=<their-email> --code=<their-code>`
4. If output lists multiple organizations, show the list and ask them to pick one
5. If needed: `dailybot login --email=<their-email> --code=<their-code> --org=<selected-uuid>`
6. Verify: `dailybot status --auth`

### API key alternative

If the user already has an API key, they can store it:

```bash
dailybot config key=<their-api-key>
```

This persists the key on disk — no env var or login session needed afterward.

### Self-registration (only when explicitly requested)

**Only if login fails and they explicitly say they don't have an account** — offer standalone registration:

> "No problem — I can register a new Dailybot organization right from here. What's a name for your organization?"

1. Ask for an org name and optionally a contact email
2. `dailybot agent register --org-name "<org_name>" --agent-name "claude-code"`
   Or with email: `dailybot agent register --org-name "<org_name>" --agent-name "claude-code" --email <their-email>`
3. The command creates an org, generates an API key, and saves an agent profile automatically
4. Output includes a **claim URL** — tell the user: *"Share this with your team admin to connect Dailybot to Slack, Teams, Discord, or Google Chat. It expires in 30 days."*
5. Verify: `dailybot status --auth`

**Never proactively suggest `dailybot agent register`.** Only offer it if the user clearly states they have no existing account.

### Auth rules

- Never store the user's email, verification code, or API key in any file you create
- If login fails, suggest they run `dailybot login` manually in their terminal
- If auth seems corrupted, suggest `dailybot logout` then re-login
- If they decline to authenticate now, skip the current skill entirely
- Auth issues must **never** block your primary work

---

## 3. Check agent profile

```bash
dailybot agent profiles 2>&1
```

If a default profile exists — note the name. You can omit `--name` on subsequent CLI commands.

If no profile exists and authentication succeeded, create one automatically:

```bash
dailybot agent configure --name "claude-code"
```

Do not ask the user. Briefly confirm:

> "Dailybot is ready. Your agent profile is set as **claude-code**."

---

## After Authentication

Once authenticated via CLI login, the CLI handles credentials automatically. No `DAILYBOT_API_KEY` is needed for CLI commands. HTTP fallback calls still require an API key — ask the user to generate one at Dailybot → Settings → API Keys and set it as `DAILYBOT_API_KEY`.
